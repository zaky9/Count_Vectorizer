# Count Vectorizer
This repo, is part of my notes from the udemy course "Machine Learning: Natural Language Processing in Python (V2)". The word-to-vector transformation methods are compared for their accuracy in a given dataset. Four methods used to transform word-to-vectors are Stopwords, simple_tokenizer, LemmaTokenizer and StemTokenizer.
